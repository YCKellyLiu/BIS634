Data show that socioeconomic factors (low SES, lack of insurance, lack of access to care) are the most significant contributors to these disparities. The greatest disparities in outcomes and mortality exist among young breast cancer subsets. We hypothesize that low SES factors and associated increased stress and poor dietary habits lead to higher incidence of childhood obesity in Hispanics. Obesity leads to increased production of serum IL-6 and other adipokines, increasing aromatase transcription; this leads to increased serum estrogen and genotoxic estrogen metabolites, contributing to higher incidence of early onset breast cancer with its worse prognosis. Recent data support this hypothesis, showing that obesity in pre-pubertal girls leads to higher serum estradiol concentrations and higher levels of genotoxic estrogen metabolites. Epidemiological data show that prolonged exposure to hormonal contraceptives leads to higher breast cancer risk, supporting the idea that a potential factor in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer disparities is a continuum of increased exposure to estrogen from early childhood to adulthood.

A minimal dose level is heavily dependent on the image reconstruction algorithms and clinical task, in which the tissue texture always plays an important role. This study aims to investigate the dependence through a task-based evaluation at multiple dose levels and variable textures in reconstructions with prospective patient studies. 133 patients with a suspicious pulmonary nodule scheduled for biopsy were recruited and the data was acquired at120kVp with three different dose levels of 100, 40 and 20mAs. Three reconstruction algorithms were implemented: analytical filtered back-projection (FBP) with optimal noise filtering; statistical Markov random field (MRF) model with optimal Huber weighting (MRF-H) for piecewise smooth reconstruction; and tissue-specific texture model (MRF-T) for texture preserved statistical reconstruction. Experienced thoracic radiologists reviewed and scored all images at random, blind to the CT dose and reconstruction algorithms. The radiologists identified the nodules in each image including the 133 biopsy target nodules and 66 other non-target nodules. For target nodule characterization, only MRF-T at 40mAs showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs. For localizing both the target nodules and the non-target nodules, some as small as 3mm, MRF-T at 40 and 20mAs levels showed no statistically significant difference from FBP at 100mAs, respectively. MRF-H and FBP at 40 and 20mAs levels performed statistically differently from FBP at 100mAs.

A THz image can be represented by a data cube with each pixel containing a high dimension spectrum vector covering several THz frequencies, where each frequency represents a different dimension in the vector. The proposed algorithm projects the high-dimension spectrum vector of each pixel within the THz image into a low-dimension subspace that contains the majority of the unique features embedded in the image. The low-dimension subspace is constructed by sequentially identifying its orthonormal basis vectors, such that each newly chosen basis vector represents the most unique information not contained by existing basis vectors. A multivariate Gaussian mixture model is used to represent the statistical distributions of the low-dimension feature vectors obtained from the proposed dimension reduction algorithm. The model parameters are iteratively learned by using unsupervised learning methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo or expectation maximization, and the results are used to classify the various regions within a tumor sample. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves apparent performance improvement in human breast cancer tissue over existing approaches such as one-dimension Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Mutagen sensitivity was assessed by exposing lymphocytes to bleomycin in vitro and quantitating the bleomycin-induced chromatid breaks per cell (b/c). Patients were classified as hypersensitive (>1 b/c) or not hypersensitive (\u22641 b/c). The mean follow-up time was 64 months (range: 5-244 months). Eighteen patients (15%) developed a SPC. The 10-year estimated rate of SPC for hypersensitive (n=65) or not hypersensitive (n=59) patients were 17% and 30%, respectively (p=0.4272). Thirty-nine percent of SPC was developed after 10-year follow-up. The 5-year cancer-specific survival was 17% following the development of SPC.

cell polarization and alignment play important roles in tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer metastasis. How cells sense the direction and position in these processes, however, has not been fully understood. Here we construct a theoretical model based on describing cell layer as a nemato-elastic medium, by which the cell polarization, cell alignment and cell active contraction are explicitly expressed as functions of components of the nematic order parameter. To determine the order parameter we derive two sets of governing equations, one for the force equilibrium of the system, and the other for the minimization of the system's free energy including the energy of cell polarization and alignment. By solving these coupled governing equations, we can predict the effects of substrate stiffness, geometries of cell layers, external forces and myosin activity on the direction- and position-dependent cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. Moreover, the axisymmetric problem with cells on a ring-like pattern is solved analytically, and the analytical solution for cell aspect ratio are governed by parameter groups which include the stiffness of the cell and the substrate, the strength of myosin activity and the external forces. Our predictions of the cell aspect ratio and orientation are generally comparable to experimental observations. These results show that the pattern of cell polarization is determined by the anisotropic degree of active contractile stress, and suggest a stress-driven polarization mechanism that enables cells to sense their spatial positions to develop direction- and position-dependent behavior.

To facilitate the ESD procedure, we have created a deployable cable driven robot that increases the surgical capabilities of the flexible endoscope while attempting to minimize the impact on the access that they offer. Using a low-profile inflatable support structure in the shape of a hollow hexagonal prism, our robot can fold around the flexible endoscope and, when the target site has been reached, achieve a 73.16% increase in volume and increase its radial stiffness. A sheath around the variable stiffness structure delivers a series of force transmission cables that connect to two independent tubular end-effectors through which standard flexible endoscopic instruments can pass and be anchored. Using a simple control scheme based on the length of each cable, the pose of the two instruments can be controlled by haptic controllers in each hand of the user.

Here, we quantify the mechanosensitivity of the lysis agent the di-rhamnolipid (RHA), which is a bacterially produced biosurfactant. RHA exhibited selective lysis correlated strongly with cortical membrane tension in osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and erythrocytes. Reducing cortical membrane tension by cytoskeleton inhibitors (cytochalasin D and nocodazole) or osmotic regulators (sucrose, polyethylene glycol, and nonionic surfactants) attenuated the RHA toxicity. The selective toxicity of RHA toward human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells over healthy blood cells suggests a potential therapy for blood cancer.

Conventional treatment approaches (e.g., radiation or chemotherapy) treat both cancerous and surrounding normal tissues simultaneously, which leads to a poor therapeutic effect on tumors and severe toxic side effects on healthy tissues. Considering these thematic issues, the design and development of more efficient treatment approaches is one of the most important demands of health care in the near future. In this context, the emergence of nanotechnology opens new opportunities for addressing the issues of conventional drug delivery systems (DDSs) for cancer therapy. Theranostic nanomedicines are indebted to the advent of nanotechnology and were introduced by Funkhouser in 2002. These nanomedicines are the newest DDSs that combine diagnostic and therapeutic properties into a single platform. Theranostic nanomedicines are generally composed of targeting agents, diagnostic tracers, effective drug(s), and biomaterial(s) as the matrix to the formulation. Among these, biomaterials have a pivotal role in theranostic nanomedicines due to their direct influence on the system effectiveness. In this context, natural polymers can be considered as potential candidates, mainly due to their inherent physicochemical as well as biological advantages. However, natural polymers have some drawbacks, which can be addressed through the chemical modification approach.

To overcome biological barriers of islet transplantation, encapsulation strategies have been developed and robustly investigated. While islet encapsulation can prevent the need for immunosuppressants, these approaches have not shown much success in clinical trials due to a lack of long-term insulin production. Multiple engineering strategies have been used to improve encapsulation and post-transplantation islet survival.

While routine screening with Pap smear testing has reduced the burden of cervical cancer in the high-income countries, the implementation of organised Pap-based screening programmes has not been found feasible in low-resource settings due to a lack of health care delivery infrastructure and limited health budgets. The well-established causal relationship between cervical cancer development and high-risk-HPV (HR-HPV) infection and the subsequent appreciation of the greater sensitivity of HPV testing over Pap smear cytology eventually lead to HPV testing being incorporated in the primary cervical cancer prevention programmes. An organised cervical cancer screening programme incorporating HR-HPV testing and HPV vaccine administration are currently considered to be the two major interventions for a comprehensive cervical cancer control programme worldwide. However, there are concerns that the requirement of a sophisticated infrastructure with its associated costs may make cervical cancer screening using molecular prevention by HPV testing impracticable to be implemented, especially in resource-poor, low-income countries. Visual Inspection with Acetic acid (VIA) represents one of the alternative methods for cervical cancer screening proposed for the countries with low- to middle-income resources and has gained popularity in India following the successful completion of two randomised controlled trials, but this method but has low sensitivity to detect cervical pre-cancers. More recently, the cost-effectiveness analysis of many studies including randomised controlled trials, even from the low-resource settings, has found that HPV testing is followed by treatment for HPV-positive women to be an effective and cost-effective screening strategy as compared to other screening methods including VIA. The incorporation of self-sampling and HPV testing by partial genotyping has the potential to significantly add to the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness.

Our Ball Covariance possesses the following attractive properties: (i) It is nonparametric and model-free, which make the proposed measure robust to model mis-specification; (ii) It is nonnegative and equal to zero if and only if two random objects in two separable Banach spaces are independent; (iii) Empirical Ball Covariance is easy to compute and can be used as a test statistic of independence.

Intense and highly focused (lateral size of several micrometers) X-ray beams combined with small steps of photon energy tuning (2-3 eV) of synchrotron radiation allowed X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques to nondestructively and simultaneously detect trace elements as well as identify their chemical affinity and speciation in situ, respectively. Although limited by measurement time and radiation damage to the tissue, these techniques are commonly used to obtain two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps of several elements at synchrotron facilities around the world. The spatial distribution and chemistry of the trace elements obtained is then correlated to the targeted anatomical structures and to the biological functions (normal or pathological). For example, synchrotron-based in vitro studies of various human tissues showed significant differences between the normal and pathological distributions of metallic trace elements such as iron, zinc, copper, and lead in relation to human diseases ranging from Parkinson's disease and cancer to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Current research effort is aimed at not only measuring the abnormal elemental distributions associated with various diseases, but also indicate or discover possible biological mechanisms that could explain such observations. While a number of studies confirmed and strengthened previous knowledge, others revealed or suggested new possible roles of trace elements or provided a more accurate spatial distribution in relation to the underlying histology.

Environmental changes (shift work, jet lag, exposure to light at night), mutations in circadian regulating genes, and changes to clock gene expression are recognized forms of disruption and are associated with cancer risk and/or cancer progression. Experimental data in animals and cell cultures further supports the role of the cellular circadian clock in coordinating cell division and DNA repair, and disrupted cellular clocks accelerate cancer cell growth.

Phototherapies mainly rely on manipulation of target tissue through photothermal, photochemical, or photomechanical interactions. Combining phototherapy with immunotherapy has the benefit of eliciting a systemic immune response. Specifically, photothermal therapy (PTT) has been shown to induce apoptosis and necrosis in cancer cells, releasing tumor associated antigenic peptides while sparing healthy host cells, through temperature increase in targeted tissue. However, the tissue temperature must be monitored and controlled to minimize adverse thermal effects on normal tissue and to avoid the destruction of tumor-specific antigens, in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effects of PTT. Techniques for monitoring PTT have evolved from post-treatment quantification methods like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, and flow cytometry to modern methods capable of real-time monitoring, such as magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging. Monitoring methods are largely chosen based on the type of light delivery to the target tissue. Interstitial methods of thermometry, such as thermocouples and fiber-optic sensors, are able to monitor temperature of the local tumor environment. However, these methods can be challenging if the phototherapy itself is interstitially administered. Increasingly, non-invasive therapies call for non-invasive monitoring, which can be achieved through magnetic resonance thermometry, computed tomography, and photoacoustic imaging techniques.

To solve a catch-22 dilemma between safety and efficacy for drug cocktails, a hetero-targeted nano-cocktail (PPPDMA) with traceless linkers has been developed. In the PPPDMA nanogel, a hetero-targeting strategy is employed to improve its tumor selective targeting efficacy by overcoming the cancer cell mono-ligand density limitation. Benefit from its glutathione and reactive oxygen species responsiveness, the loaded paclitaxel and doxorubicin can be quickly and tracelessly released into the cytoplasm in their original form, which bestows PPPDMA nanogels the capability to overwhelm the processing capacity of cancer cell's P-glycoprotein efflux pump allows, and ultimately kill them without inducing side effects. The PPPDMA treatment reduced its tumor burden over 99% (in tumor weight) and 96% (in tumor number). Most importantly, no detectable tumor in more than half of the PPPDMA treated mice.

Common challenges in set-based genetic association testing include weak effect sizes, correlation between SNPs in a SNP-set, and scarcity of signals, with individual SNP effects often ranging from extremely sparse to moderately sparse in number. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for the association between a SNP-set and outcome. The GBJ extends the Berk-Jones statistic by accounting for correlation among SNPs, and it provides advantages over the Generalized Higher Criticism test when signals in a SNP-set are moderately sparse. We also provide an analytic p-value calculation for SNP-sets of any finite size, and we develop an omnibus statistic that is robust to the degree of signal sparsity. An additional advantage of our work is the ability to conduct inference using individual SNP summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We evaluate the finite sample performance of the GBJ through simulation and apply the method to identify breast cancer risk genes in a GWAS conducted by the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility Consortium.

DNA was extracted from cervical smears of 20 cases and 30 controls. The DNA was bisulphite modified.

However, these methods are not flexible enough to handle aberrant patterns of gene expression data, e.g., inconsistent cell type-specific gene expression between purified reference samples and tumor samples. We propose a novel statistical method for expression deconvolution called ICeD-T (Immune Cell Deconvolution in Tumor tissues). ICeD-T automatically identifies aberrant genes whose expression are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and down-weights their contributions to cell type abundance estimates. We evaluated the performance of ICeD-T versus existing methods in simulation studies and several real data analyses. ICeD-T displayed comparable or superior performance to these competing methods.

To reach such a purpose, the engineered tLyp-1-lamp2b plasmids were constructed and amplified in Escherichia coli. The tLyp-1-lamp2b plasmids were further used to transfect HEK293T tool cells and the targeting tLyp-1 exosomes were isolated from secretion of the transfected HEK293T cells.

Results showed that the engineered targeting tLyp-1 exosomes had a nanosized structure (approximately 100\u202fnm) and high transfection efficiency into lung cancer and cancer stem cells.

Although survival from any pediatric cancer has improved dramatically during past decades, a number of cancers continue to yield dismal prognoses, which has motivated the continued study of novel therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, even patients cured of pediatric cancer often experience severe adverse effects of treatment and other long-term health implications, such as cardiotoxicity or loss of fertility. For these patients, improved risk stratification to identify those who could safely receive alternate or less-intensive therapy without affecting prognosis is a key objective. Fortunately, pediatric cancers are rare overall, but even among patients with the same narrow cancer type, there is often broad heterogeneity in terms of prognosis, molecular features or pathology, current treatment strategies, and scientific objectives. As a result, the design of clinical trials in the pediatric cancer setting is challenged by a number of practical issues that must be addressed to ensure trial feasibility for this vulnerable group of patients. In this review, we discuss some of the unique trial design considerations often encountered in any rare tumor setting through the lens of our experiences as faculty statisticians for the Children's Oncology Group, the largest organization in the world dedicated exclusively to pediatric cancer research and clinical trials.

In addition, the cost and time exerted for genomic profiling needs to be balanced with expectations of benefit for each patient. This article summarizes the effort to implement precision oncology in Japan. The most promising development is that tests to profile the genomes of select cancers are now fully covered by the national health insurance system. In May 2019, two gene panels were approved with reimbursement: FoundationOne CDx Cancer Genomic Profile and OncoGuide NCC Oncopanel System, the latter of which was developed in Japan. To make better use of scarce resources, the reimbursement is restricted to patients with solid tumors that have progressed on standard chemotherapy, rare tumors, or tumors of unknown primary. To centralize Japanese precision oncology, the government designated approximately 170 hospitals and stratified them to three layers on the basis of their roles. In addition, Japan's National Cancer Center launched a Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (C-CAT) that collects genomic information and clinical characteristics of patients who received genomic profiling tests. C-CAT is expected to be the central data repository, to match patients with clinical trials, and to assist translational research. The centralized system under the national health insurance system could be a double-edged sword. Although tight regulation may make it hard to keep up with the rapid development of precision oncology, a federated ecosystem for sharing clinical and genomic data will be a precious asset and allow for shared access to data.

In this article, we review the concepts and methodology of early-phase cancer trial designs with a focus on dose finding and treatment screening and put these methods in the context of platform trials of molecularly targeted cancer therapies.

A key thrust of this modern drug development paradigm is successful identification of predictive biomarkers that can distinguish patients who might be sensitive to new targeted therapies. To respond to this challenge, a number of phase III cancer trial designs integrating biomarker-based objectives have been proposed and implemented in oncology drug development. In this article, we provide an updated review of commonly used biomarker-based randomized clinical trial designs, with a particular focus on design efficiency. When the efficacy of a new therapy may be limited to a biomarker-defined subgroup, the choice of an appropriate randomized clinical trial design should be guided by the strength of the biomarker's credentials. If compelling evidence indicates that a targeted therapy is beneficial only in a particular biomarker-defined subgroup, an enrichment design should be used. If there is strong evidence that the treatment is likely to be more beneficial in the biomarker-positive patients but a meaningful benefit is also possible in the biomarker-negative patients, then a properly powered biomarker-stratified design (eg, a subgroup-specific or Marker Sequential Test strategy) would provide the most rigorous determination of the sensitive populations. If the evidence supporting the predictive value of the biomarker is weak and the treatment is expected to work in the overall population, then a fallback design could be used.

Carcinomas developing in patients tend to downregulate ANXA1 expression as compared to their normal tissues of origin.

They can directly kill bacteria or interact with the crucial events of pathogenicity, thereby decreasing the ability of bacteria to develop resistance.

Although these nano-Cd containing particles can be capped with shells to reduce their cytotoxicity, these shells would be gradually disintegrated after a certain period of time, thereby inevitably exerting nanotoxicity. Previously, we showed that treatment of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with uncapped CdTe QDs (520Q, 580Q and 730Q with emission maximum at 520, 580 and 730 nm, respectively) elicited dose-dependent cytotoxicity for 520Q and 580Q (<5 nm), while 730Q (>5 nm) elicited negligible cytotoxicity. In order to gain a more global perspective on the action mechanism of these nano-Cd particles, here, we further characterized the proteome response of BEAS-2B when challenged with the above QDs. Interestingly, among the three nano-Cd particles, we observed that 520Q and 580Q treatment altered the BEAS-2B proteome significantly in a very similar magnitude while 730Q has no obvious impact at all, as compared with the untreated control. Notably, the treatment of BEAS-2B with glutathione before nano-Cd particles abrogated the induction/repression of differentially expressed proteins and prevented cell death. Taken together, our findings show that uncapped CdTe nanoparticles (520Q and 580Q) induce oxidative stress in human bronchial epithelial cells, and the similarly altered protein signatures also suggest potential mitotoxicity and common cellular and detoxification responses upon exposure of lung cells to these two QDs.

The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field.

The results of the present study revealed that the inhibition of CDKs using pan-CDK inhibitor AT7519, as revealed by the induction of G1 cell cycle arrest as well as the reduction of cyclins expression, resulted in decreased survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived KG-1 cells, either in the context of single agent or in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO). Apart from alterations in the expression of proliferation and apoptotic genes, the anti-survival property of AT7519 was coupled with the inhibition of autophagy-related genes. Notably, we found that the blockage of autophagy system in KG-1 cells resulted in a superior cytotoxic effect, introducing autophagy as a probable suppressor of cell death. As far as we are aware, to date, no study has reported the contributory mechanisms correlated with the less sensitivity of acute leukemia cells to AT7519 and our study suggested for the first time that the activation of both PI3K and c-Myc signaling pathways could overshadow, at least partly, the efficacy of this agent in KG-1 cells.

In external exposure, mainly beta radiation from the decay products contributes to DU toxicity. Internal exposure to DU is more important and can occur through ingestion of DU-contaminated water and food and inhalation of DU aerosols. There is limited information about health effects and mechanism of DU after environmental exposure. Kidney is reported as the main target organ for the chemical toxicity of this metal that was reported in Persian Gulf syndrome. Alterations in behavior, some neurologic adverse effects, immunotoxicity, embryo-toxicity and hepatotoxicity were observed in chronic exposure to DU. Also, the increased risk of cancer was revealed in epidemiological and experimental studies. Several mechanisms were suggested for DU toxicity such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial toxicity and inflammation. In fact, uranium like other toxic heavy metals can induce oxidative damage and apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway and inflammatory response.

How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior. A split Bregman algorithm was used to minimize the variational model. The proposed method was validated on a non-small cell lung cancer dataset with 84 PET/CT images. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1). Only a few training samples were needed for training the designed network to produce the probability map; 2). The proposed method can be applied to small datasets, normally seen in clinic research; 3). The proposed method successfully fused the complementary information in PET/CT, and outperformed two existing deep learning-based multimodality segmentation methods and other multimodality segmentation methods using traditional fusion strategies (without deep learning); 4).

With modern lifespan the postmenopausal attenuation of circulating estrogen levels can negatively impact a women's life for 30-40 years. The major hypoestrogenic consequence is hot flushes but decline in cognitive function, sleep disorders, depression/anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis are also characteristic for the menopause. Current treatments of hot flushes include estrogen therapy alone or in combination with progestins, soy products, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. However, with the exception of estrogens, none of these have satisfactory efficacy. But estrogens come with the unwanted side effects in the periphery, including stimulation of the uterus and breast leading to elevated cancer risk. Therefore, a tremendous effort has been devoted to developing safer therapies and the research has utilized classic rodent models of hot flush with considerable limitations. As hot flushes are primate-specific symptoms, the development of a non-invasive primate hot flush model would have a tremendous impact on drug development. Therefore, our aim was to develop such a non-human primate (NHP) model a hot flush that both recapitulates flushes women experience and is minimally invasive. We investigated if recent developments in thermal imaging have made it possible to accurately monitor skin temperature via camera imaging. In this study, the skin temperature of an ovariectomized rhesus monkey was measured continuously with an infrared camera in a freely moving animal over long time period. Following mapping skin temperatures of several areas of the neck and face we found that the nose of the monkeys showed that largest changes in skin temperature. In the ovariectomized monkey the temperature of the skin on the nose shows up to 9 \u00b0C elevations representing hot flushes. In the untreated monkey, hot flushes occurred more frequently in late afternoon/early evening hours than in the morning and last for several minutes. We observed 58 flushes in the 64 evenings of observation. The average number of hot flushes was 0.51 per evening. Oral administration of biotin (niacin) for seven days exaggerated the number of hot flushes to 2.43 per evening. Oral treatment with estradiol benzoate prevented hot flushes and only 2 flushes were detected in the 12 evenings after treatment, averaging 0.17 per evening.

The vast majority of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) continues to rely on AR activity.

However, with just a single creatinine concentration included in the denominator of the creatinine clearance equation, the resulting value seems to apply only in the steady state. Does the basic clearance formula work in the nonsteady state, and can it recapitulate the kinetic glomerular filtration rate (GFR) equation? In the kinetic state, a nonlinear creatinine trajectory is reducible into a \"true average\" value that can be found using calculus, proceeding from a differential equation based on the mass balance principle. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we prove definitively that the true average is the correct creatinine to divide by, even as the mathematical model accommodates clinical complexities such as volume change and other factors that affect creatinine kinetics. The true average of a creatinine versus time function between 2 measured creatinine values is found by a definite integral. To use the true average to compute kinetic GFR, 2 techniques are demonstrated, a graphical one and a numerical one. We apply this concept to a clinical case of an individual with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis; despite the effects of hemodialysis on serum creatinine concentration, kinetic GFR was able to track the underlying kidney function and provided critical information regarding kidney function recovery. Finally, a prior concept of the maximum increase in creatinine per day is made more clinically objective.

Because patients with APL present a tendency for severe bleeding, often resulting in an early fatal course, APL was historically considered to be one of the most fatal forms of acute leukemia. However, therapeutic advances, including anthracycline- and cytarabine-based chemotherapy, have significantly improved the outcomes of APL patients. Due to the further introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and-more recently-the development of arsenic trioxide (ATO)-containing regimens, APL is currently the most curable form of AML in adults.

More specifically, it is found that poststretched breast cancer cells are found in low grades of invasion; they substantially upregulate the expression of manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) through activation of H-Ras proteins, which subsequently induce aerobic glycolysis followed by an overproduction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-reinforced filopodias. Presence of such invadopodias facilitates targeting of the endothelial layer, and increased invasive behaviors in breast cells are observed.", "Query": ["CANCER"], "MeshHeading": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Glycolysis", "Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Stress, Mechanical"]}, "32648654": {"ArticleTitle": "3D Microenvironment Stiffness Regulates Tumor Spheroid Growth and Mechanics via p21 and ROCK.", "AbstractText": "The mechanical properties of cancer cells and their microenvironment contribute to breast cancer progression. While mechanosensing has been extensively studied using 2D substrates, much less is known about it in a physiologically more relevant 3D context. Here it is demonstrated that breast cancer tumor spheroids, growing in 3D polyethylene glycol-heparin hydrogels, are sensitive to their environment stiffness. During tumor spheroid growth, compressive stresses of up to 2 kPa build up, as quantitated using elastic polymer beads as stress sensors. Atomic force microscopy reveals that tumor spheroid stiffness increases with hydrogel stiffness. Also, constituent cell stiffness increases in a Rho associated kinase (ROCK)- and F-actin-dependent manner. Increased hydrogel stiffness correlated with attenuated tumor spheroid growth, a higher proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase, and elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Drug-mediated ROCK inhibition not only reverses cell stiffening upon culture in stiff hydrogels but also increases tumor spheroid growth. Taken together, a mechanism by which the growth of a tumor spheroid can be regulated via cytoskeleton rearrangements in response to its mechanoenvironment is revealed here.

Although LN-cells and cellular responses play a pivotal role in cancer metastasis, the interplay between LN-cells and PCa cells is undetermined due to the small size and widespread distribution of LNs. To identify factors responsible for LN metastasis, a 3D cell culture biosystem is fabricated to simulate LN responses during metastasis. First, it is determined that LN explants previously exposed to high metastatic PCa release substantially more chemotactic factors to promote metastatic PCa migration than those exposed to low-metastatic PCa. Furthermore, T-lymphocytes are found to produce chemotactic factors in LNs, among which, CXCL12, CCL21, and IL-10 are identified to have the most chemotactic effect. To mimic the LN microenvironment, Cytodex beads are seeded with T cells to produce a LN-mimetic biosystem in both static and flow conditions. As expected, the flow condition permits prolonged cellular responses.

However, the low tumor-targeting ability limits the wide clinical application of chemotherapy. The microenvironment plays a critical role in many aspects of tumor genesis. It generates the tumor vasculature and it is highly implicated in the progression to metastasis. To maintain a suitable environment for tumor progression, there are special microenvironment in tumor cell, such as low pH, high level of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and more special enzymes, which is different to normal cell. Microenvironment-targeted therapy strategy could create new opportunities for therapeutic targeting. Compared to other targeting strategies, microenvironment-targeted therapy strategy will control the drug release into tumor cells more accurately. Redox responsive drug delivery systems (DDSs) are developed based on the high level of GSH in tumor cells. However, there are also GSH in normal cell though its level is lower. In order to control the release of drugs more accurately and reduce side effects, other drug release stimuli have been introduced to redox responsive DDSs. Under the synergistic reaction of two stimuli, redox dual-stimuli responsive DDSs will control the release of drugs more accurately and quickly and even increase the accumulation. This review summarizes strategies of redox dual-stimuli responsive DDSs such as pH, light, enzyme, ROS, and magnetic guide to delivery chemotherapeutic agents more accurately, aiming at providing new ideas for further promoting the drug release, enhancing tumor-targeting and improving anticancer effects.

The contemporary approach of understanding the cancer biology from a \"within the cell\" perspective has been largely challenged with complex and intricate \"outside the cell\" events. Thus understanding the biology of the tumor microenvironment has been of scientific and clinical interest. Small non-coding microRNAs with a pleotropic and wide range of cellular gene targets can be reasonably hypothesized to regulate the events of carcinogenesis and progression. MicroRNAs have been investigated in different cancer models, and evidence of their involvement in the regulation of the tumor microenvironment has been of much interest. In particular, a major interest has been exploring the role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating the interaction of cancer cells with surrounding stromal components and the effect of such interactions on the cancer cells. Fine-tuned regulation by these microRNAs extends our contemporary understanding of these small biomolecules in epigenetic regulations.

Throughout this guideline many transition points have been identified, for example from one service provider to another, from one setting to another from one age group to another and from one life style to another. There appear to be no studies which are universally applicable to all transitions. Studies have included transitions between teams for example within a hospital or from hospital to home. Usually systems have been developed locally to meet identified problems with transitions, for example the use of a form or computer template, patient held records similar to those used in ante natal care. Probably the group where transition has been studied most is the transfer from children\u2019s to young persons or adult services and most of this work has been undertaken in cancer service and for those with learning difficulties. Another area where work has been undertaken is in the discharge of people from hospital to home and the copying letters to patients is an initiative, which has its roots in this area. There appear to be some principles, which can help to make these transitions smoother. These include effective methods of communication, verbal, written, and electronic, between all those involved. It is most effective if the person who is being transferred and their relatives, carers and those important to them are all included. However there does not appear to be one factor that overwhelmingly contributes to a smooth discharge but a number of things which taken in combination makes transitions smoother. RAPID DISCHARGE: For patients who require rapid discharge to their preferred place of death (usually their home from hospital) there is a need for a clear process that allows for the timely initiation of resources with which to facilitate this care planning. This may or may not necessitate rapid access to specialist palliative care. It is dependent on the patient\u2019s wishes being known to health care professional and relatives usually in the form of and Advanced Care Plan (ACP) and Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders and the ability of local system processes to enable the prompt implementation of support services once the patient has arrived at their preferred place of death. As with all rapid discharges what underpins them is effective communication with all parties and clear, concise documentation that allows for a smooth transition of care. With an ever-increasing pressure on services provided by health care providers, there is a widespread recognition that effective discharge planning from the time of admission is essential to enable a patient centred pathway, which is both safe and effective. The rapid discharge of patients is multi-factorial being dependent on realistic estimated day of discharge, senior decision making, effective communication, liaison with other health care partners, the families and most importantly the patient themselves.

In vivo, inhibition of lipophagy or its downstream catabolic pathway reverses defective phenotypes caused by Tsc1-null NSCs and reduces tumorigenesis in mouse models.

Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our multiscale networks utilizing the WSI image pyramids can achieve higher accuracy for the classification of breast cancer.

(2) Facilities (supply) and patients (demand) in a health care market interact with each other across geopolitical borders, and measures of health care accessibility need to capture that. (3) Our health outcome is the result of joint effects of individual attributes and neighborhood characteristics, and an adequate definition of neighborhood is critical for assessing neighborhood effect. (4) Disease rates in areas of small population are unreliable, and one effective way to mitigate the problem is to construct a larger, internally-homogenous and comparable area unit.

Unlike radioactive sulfur colloid which requires nuclear medicine facilities, methylene blue dye is readily available. The purpose of this study is to validate the use of methylene blue dye alone for SLNB in early breast cancer patients. 60 patients of early breast cancer were randomized to receive either methylene blue alone (Group A-30 patients) or a combination of both methylene blue and radioactive colloid (Group B-30 patients) for detection of sentinel lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was done followed by complete axillary dissection in all patients. In both Groups A and B, sentinel node was identified in all 30 patients, giving identification rate of 100%. In group A, sentinel node was the only positive node in 1 patient, with a false-positive rate of 14.2%. The negative predictive value was 91.3%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 75% with a specificity of 95.45%. The overall accuracy was 90%. In group B, sentinel node was the only positive node in 2 cases, giving a false-positive rate of 28.7%. The negative predictive value was 95.65%. The sensitivity of the procedure in predicting further axillary disease was 83.33% with a specificity of 91.67%. The overall accuracy was 90%. Although the false-negative rate was slightly higher with methylene blue alone than that using combination (8.6%-4.3%), it was statistically insignificant. Similarly the sensitivity (75%-83.33%), specificity (95.45-91.67%), and negative predictive value (91.3%-95.67%) were also comparable between groups A and B, respectively. Negative predictive value and false-negative rates are comparable, whether blue dye is used alone or a combination of blue dye and radioactive colloid is used. Sentinel lymph node biopsy with blue dye alone is reliable and can be put to clinical practice more widely, even if nuclear medicine facilities are not available in resource constrained centers, so as to reduce long-term morbidity of axillary dissection, with similar oncological outcomes.", "Query": ["CANCER"], "MeshHeading": []}, "32523265": {"ArticleTitle": "Use of Bilateral Nasolabial Flaps with Coronoidectomy as a Novel Approach to a Case of Oral Cancer with Severe Trismus.", "AbstractText": "Patients with oral malignancy often have associated trismus.

We aimed to evaluate subjectively the subjective long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes of the RAFF donor site. Patients who underwent RAFF reconstruction for intra-oral defects between 2014 and 2016 were included. Two questionnaires (Cosmesis and Sensibility and Forearm Disability) were administered. Fifty-two patients who completed a 2-year follow-up were identified. Thirty-five patients (67%) had complaints regarding the donor site. With regard to cosmesis and sensibility, hand numbness was seen in 21 (40.4%) patients. With regard to forearm disability, a problem in lifting heavy weights was seen in 22 (42.3%) patients. Only three patients in the entire cohort had complaints regarding the cosmesis of the forearm scar. Overall disability score was low (7.83). With regard to donor site morbidity, numbness and difficulty in lifting weights was the most common complaint. There is good acceptance of the donor site and scar with minimum morbidity.

Like U1 role in splicing, telescripting requires U1 snRNA base-pairing with nascent transcripts. Inhibition of U1 base-pairing with U1 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (U1 AMO) mimics widespread PCPA from cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in human tissues, including PCPA in introns and last exons' 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs). U1 telescripting-PCPA balance changes generate diverse RNAs depending on where in a gene it occurs. Long genes are highly U1-telescripting-dependent because of PASs in introns compared to short genes. Enrichment of cell cycle control, differentiation, and developmental functions in long genes, compared to housekeeping and acute cell stress response genes in short genes, reveals a gene size-function relationship in mammalian genomes. This polarization increased in metazoan evolution by previously unexplained intron expansion, suggesting that U1 telescripting could shift global gene expression priorities. We show that that modulating U1 availability can profoundly alter cell phenotype, such as cancer cell migration and invasion, underscoring the critical role of U1 homeostasis and suggesting it as a potential target for therapies.

Moreover, typical options, including observation, radiation, and surgery, may often have equipoise for some patients and their tumors. Therefore, a patient-centered approach, strongly guided by the expertise of experienced skull base surgeons, may likely be the most appropriate type of care for patients with ANs. Herein, we review the documented use of patient-centered care in other aspects of medicine, propose the benefits of this approach for patients with ANs, and provide ways this can be better implemented in practice.", "Query": ["CANCER"], "MeshHeading": []}, "32494578": {"ArticleTitle": "Organophosphate Ester Flame Retardants: Are They a Regrettable Substitution for Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers?", "AbstractText": "As the use of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and the entire class of organohalogen flame retardants, is declining, the use of organophosphate esters flame retardants (OPFRs) is increasing.

Unfortunately, various day-to-day lifestyle choices and environmental factors, unrelated to the presence of any disease, can cause stress sufficient to contribute to the development of various diseases/disorders and suboptimal health. There is evidence suggesting that counseling in stress management-oriented therapeutic interventions (as offered by lifestyle medicine-oriented practitioners) may prevent or reduce the onset, severity, duration, and/or overall burden of stress-related illnesses. Such counseling often involves considerations such as the patient's nutrition, physical activity, interest in/capacity to meditate, drug abuse/cessation, and so on.

In addition, recent work has demonstrated that incorporating known biological knowledge, such as those from functional genomics, into the statistical analysis of genomic data offers great promise of improved predictive accuracy and feature selection. Such biological knowledge can often be represented by graphs. In this article, we propose a novel knowledge-guided nonlinear Bayesian SVM approach for analysis of high-dimensional data. Our model uses graph information that represents the relationship among the features to guide feature selection. To achieve knowledge-guided feature selection, we assign an Ising prior to the indicators representing inclusion/exclusion of the features in the model. An efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for posterior inference. The performance of our method is evaluated and compared with several penalized linear SVM and the standard kernel SVM method in terms of prediction and feature selection in extensive simulation studies.

They are made up of protofilaments composed of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides that are held together with extraordinary stability by a network of tight steric zippers and axial hydrogen bonds. This review explores the hypothesis that the peptide conformation within a protofilament represents the physical embodiment of a \"strain\" of AD. Evidence suggests that within a single strain the fold of individual peptides is invariant. However, the fibrils are capable of structural polymorphism that includes variation in the arrangement of protofilaments into fibrils, the pitch of the resultant fibrils, and the higher-order organization of the plaques into which they aggregate. These intrastrain polymorphisms are separated by low energy barriers, allowing multiple configurations to coexist within a single preparation or tissue. Clinical presentation of different strains may be determined by variation in the way different protofilament structures generate the relevant toxic species, be they monomers, oligomers, or higher-order structures. Evidence reviewed here is consistent with a model in which disease progression is concomitant with a gradual, progressive annealing of amyloid fibrils from benign, loosely packed structures into dense neurotoxic aggregates. This model challenges the commonly held hypothesis that oligomers of A\u03b2 peptides are the only active proximate species in neurodegeneration. However, the data do not implicate fibrils themselves. Rather, they cast suspicion on larger-scale supramolecular aggregates as toxic agents. Electron tomography of amyloid plaques in situ strongly suggests that the formation of amyloid aggregates results in perturbation of the cellular membrane integrity, warranting further investigation of this as a potential mode of neurotoxicity. If dense supramolecular amyloid aggregates prove to be important agents of neurodegeneration in AD, this model may also have relevance to other forms of amyloidoses.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloidosis", "Humans", "Plaque, Amyloid"]}, "33323224": {"ArticleTitle": "Healthy ageing through internet counselling in the elderly (HATICE): a multinational, randomised controlled trial.", "AbstractText": "Although web-based interventions have been promoted for cardiovascular risk management over the past decade, there is limited evidence for effectiveness of these interventions in people older than 65 years.

Using two hiPSC lines, we demonstrated that Brownjohn's protocol can rapidly generate iMG that morphologically and functionally resembled microglia. The iMG cells we generated were found to be transcriptionally similar to previously reported iMG, as well as fetal and adult microglia. Furthermore, by using cell type-specific gene expression to partition disease heritability, we showed that iMG cells are genetically relevant to AD but found no significant enrichments of risk loci of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, or body mass index. Across a range of neuronal and immune cell types, we found only iMG, primary microglia, and microglia-like cell types exhibited a significant enrichment for AD heritability.

Positive and synergistic associations between the different types of protein deposits have been reported, leading to worse prognosis and cognitive decline. A large variation in phenotypic clinical presentation of these diseases, largely due to the frequent presence of co-pathologies, makes differential diagnosis challenging.

Tau aggregation in the different Tauopathies differs in the affected cell type, the structure of aggregates and Tau isoform composition. However, in all Tauopathies, accumulation of pathological Tau in well-characterized and well-defined brain regions, correlates strongly with symptoms associated with the dysfunction of this brain region. Hence, symptoms of neurodegenerative Tauopathies can range from motoric to cognitive and behavioral symptoms, even extending to deterioration of vital functions when the disease progresses, or combinations of different symptoms governed by the affected brain regions. The most common Tauopathies are corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and frontotemporal dementias with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). However a growing number of diseases are characterized by Tau aggregation amounting to a large family of more than 20 disorders [176]. Most Tauopathies are sporadic, and are hence linked to a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. However, mutations in MAPT have been identified which are autosomal dominantly linked to Tauopathies, including FTDP, PSP and CBD [94, 163, 185] (Alzforum, https://www.alzforum.org/mutations/mapt ). More than 80 mutations have been identified in MAPT, both in intronic and exonic regions of the human MAPT. These mutations can be classified as missense mutations or splicing mutations. Most missense mutations cluster in or near the microtubule binding site of Tau, while most splicing mutations affect the splicing of exon 10 (encoding the R2 domain), and hence affect the 3R/4R ratio. While Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the most prevalent Tauopathy, no mutations in MAPT associated with AD have been identified. Brains of AD patients are pathologically characterized by the combined presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [171]. Familial forms of AD, termed early onset familial AD (EOFAD) with clinical mutations in APP or PS1/2, have an early onset, and are invariably characterized by the combined presence of amyloid and Tau pathology [24, 80, 170]. These EOFAD cases, identify a causal link between APP/PS1 misprocessing and the development of Tau pathology and neurodegeneration [80, 170]. Furthermore, combined genetic, pathological, biomarker and in vivo modelling data, indicate that amyloid pathology precedes Tau pathology, and support a role for A\u03b2 as initiator and Tau as executor in the pathogenetic process of AD [80, 96, 97]. Hence, AD is often considered as a secondary Tauopathy (similar as for Down syndrome patients), in contrast to the primary Tauopathies described above. Tau aggregates in Tauopathies vary with respect to the ratio of different Tau isoforms (3R/4R), to the cell types displaying Tau aggregation and the structure of the aggregates.

Extracellular Tau could be actively secreted by one cell then taken up by adjacent cells, leading to the cell-to-cell transmission of Tau.

Tauopathy induces loss of synapses, which is one of the earliest structural correlates of cognitive dysfunction and disease progression.

Signs of fast axonal transport disruption are pervasive in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and various mechanisms have been proposed for regulation of fast axonal transport by tau. Post-translational modifications of tau including phosphorylation at specific sites, FTDP-17 point mutations, and oligomerization, confer upon tau a toxic effect on fast axonal transport. Consistent with the well-established dependence of axons on fast axonal transport, these disease-related modifications are closely associated temporally and spatially with axonal degeneration in the early disease stages.

Even if omics data exist, systematic drug repurposing study for AD has suffered from lack of big data, insufficient clinical information, and difficulty in data integration on account of sample heterogeneity derived from poor diagnosis or shortage of qualified post-mortem tissue. In this study, we developed a proteotranscriptomic-based computational drug repositioning method named Drug Repositioning Perturbation Score/Class (DRPS/C) based on inverse associations between disease- and drug-induced gene and protein perturbation patterns, incorporating pharmacogenomic knowledge. We constructed a Drug-induced Gene Perturbation Signature Database (DGPSD) comprised of 61,019 gene signatures perturbed by 1,520 drugs from the Connectivity Map (CMap) and the L1000 CMap.

While animal models have been valuable in elucidating disease mechanisms and in providing insights into the function of specific genes, the predictive validity of preclinical models to test potential therapies has been questioned. In the last two decades, diverse new murine models of Down syndrome (DS) have been developed and numerous studies have demonstrated neurobiological alterations that could be responsible for the cognitive and behavioral phenotypes found in this syndrome. In many cases, similar alterations were found in murine models and in individuals with DS, although several phenotypes shown in animals have yet not been confirmed in the human condition. Some of the neurobiological alterations observed in mice have been proposed to account for their changes in cognition and behavior, and have received special attention because of being putative therapeutic targets. Those include increased oxidative stress, altered neurogenesis, overexpression of the Dyrk1A gene, GABA-mediated overinhibition and Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration. Subsequently, different laboratories have tested the efficacy of pharmacotherapies targeting these alterations. Unfortunately, animal models are limited in their ability to mimic the extremely complex process of human neurodevelopment and neuropathology. Therefore, the safety and efficacy identified in animal studies are not always translated to humans, and most of the drugs tested have not demonstrated any positive effect or very limited efficacy in clinical trials. Despite their limitations, though, animal trials give us extremely valuable information for developing and testing drugs for human use that cannot be obtained from molecular or cellular experiments alone. This chapter reviews some of these therapeutic approaches and discusses some reasons that could account for the discrepancy between the findings in mouse models of DS and in humans, including: (i) the incomplete resemble of the genetic alterations of available mouse models of DS and human trisomy 21, (ii) the lack of evidence that some of the phenotypic alterations found in mice (e.g., GABA-mediated overinhibition, and alterations in adult neurogenesis) are also present in DS individuals, and (iii) the inaccuracy and/or inadequacy of the methods used in clinical trials to detect changes in the cognitive and behavioral functions of people with DS. Despite the shortcomings of animal models, animal experimentation remains an invaluable tool in developing drugs.

Scientists are gradually moving away from the simple assumption, as proposed in the original amyloid hypothesis, to new theories of pathogenesis, including gamma oscillations, prion transmission, cerebral vasoconstriction, growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1\u03b1 (GHSR1\u03b1)-mediated mechanism, and infection. To place these findings in context, we first reviewed the neuropathology of AD and further discussed new insights in the pathogenesis of AD.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": []}, "31993440": {"ArticleTitle": "Challenges of Integrative Disease Modeling in Alzheimer's Disease.", "AbstractText": "Dementia-related diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have a tremendous social and economic cost. A deeper understanding of its underlying pathophysiologies may provide an opportunity for earlier detection and therapeutic intervention. Previous approaches for characterizing AD were targeted at single aspects of the disease. Yet, due to the complex nature of AD, the success of these approaches was limited. However, in recent years, advancements in integrative disease modeling, built on a wide range of AD biomarkers, have taken a global view on the disease, facilitating more comprehensive analysis and interpretation. Integrative AD models can be sorted in two primary types, namely hypothetical models and data-driven models. The latter group split into two subgroups: (i) Models that use traditional statistical methods such as linear models, (ii) Models that take advantage of more advanced artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning. While many integrative AD models have been published over the last decade, their impact on clinical practice is limited. There exist major challenges in the course of integrative AD modeling, namely data missingness and censoring, imprecise human-involved priori knowledge, model reproducibility, dataset interoperability, dataset integration, and model interpretability.

Moreover, the A\u03b2 degradation is changed from the conventional lysosomal/autophagy to the proteasomal pathway in the presence of MCPZFS NPs.

Tau protein binds to microtubules and is best known for its role in regulating microtubule dynamics. However, if tau protein is phosphorylated by activated major tau kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 or cyclin-dependent kinase 5, or inactivated tau phosphatase, including protein phosphatase 2A, its affinity for microtubules is reduced, and the free tau is believed to aggregate, thereby forming neurofibrillary tangles. We previously reported that pitavastatin decreases the total and phosphorylated tau protein using a cellular model of tauopathy. The reduction of tau was considered to be due to Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition by pitavastatin. ROCK plays important roles to organize the actin cytoskeleton, an expected therapeutic target of human disorders. Several ROCK inhibitors are clinically applied to prevent vasospasm postsubarachnoid hemorrhage (fasudil) and for the treatment of glaucoma (ripasudil). We have examined the effects of ROCK inhibitors (H1152, Y-27632, and fasudil [HA-1077]) on tau protein phosphorylation in detail. A human neuroblastoma cell line (M1C\u00a0cells) that expresses wild-type tau protein (4R0N) by tetracycline-off (TetOff) induction, primary cultured mouse neurons, and a mouse model of tauopathy (rTG4510 line) were used. The levels of phosphorylated tau and caspase-cleaved tau were reduced by the ROCK inhibitors. Oligomeric tau levels were also reduced by ROCK inhibitors. After ROCK inhibitor treatment, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and caspase were inactivated, protein phosphatase 2A was activated, and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 were reduced.

As such, both proteins became the focus of intense scrutiny, and served as the principal pathogenic target for hundreds of clinical trials. However, with varying efficacy, none of these investigations produced a disease-modifying therapy - offering patients with AD little recourse aside from transient, symptomatic medications. The near universal failure of clinical trials is unprecedented for a major research discipline. In part, this has motivated an increasing skepticism of the relevance of protein misfolding to AD's etiology. Several recent observations, principally the presence of significant protein pathologies in non-demented seniors, have lent credence to an apparent cursory role for A\u03b2 and tau. Herein, we review both A\u03b2 and tau, examining the processes from their biosynthesis to their pathogenesis and evaluate their vulnerability to medicinal intervention.

However, there are at least four common issues associated with the existing fusion methods. First, many existing fusion methods simply concatenate features from each modality without considering the correlations among different modalities. Second, most existing methods often make prediction based on a single classifier, which might not be able to address the heterogeneity of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Third, many existing methods often employ feature selection (or reduction) and classifier training in two independent steps, without considering the fact that the two pipelined steps are highly related to each other. Forth, there are missing neuroimaging data for some of the participants (e.g., missing PET data), due to the participants' \"no-show\" or dropout. In this paper, to address the above issues, we propose an early AD diagnosis framework via novel multi-modality latent space inducing ensemble SVM classifier.

AD-related biomarkers assessed were medial temporal lobe volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Hierarchical linear regressions were implemented to examine the effects of BMI and polygenic hazard score on AD-related biomarkers. Results showed that BMI moderated the relationship between genetic risk for AD and medial temporal lobe volume, such that individuals with high BMI and high genetic risk for AD showed lower volume in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In sex-stratified analyses, these results remained significant only in females. Finally, BMI and genetic risk for AD were independently associated with CSF biomarkers of AD. These results provide evidence that high BMI is associated with lower volume in AD-vulnerable brain regions in individuals at genetic risk for AD, particularly females.

Ferritin is a 24 subunit spherical shell protein composed of both light (FTL) and heavy chain (FTH1) subunits, possessing complimentary iron-handling functions and forming three-fold and four-fold pores. Iron uptake through the three-fold pores is well-defined, but the unloading process somewhat less and generally focuses on lysosomal ferritin degradation although it may have an additional, energetically efficient pore mechanism. Hereditary Ferritinopathy (HF) or neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the FTL C-terminal sequence, which in turn cause disorder and unraveling at the four-fold pores allowing iron leakage and enhanced formation of toxic, improperly coordinated iron (ICI). Histopathologically, HF is characterized by iron deposition and formation of ferritin inclusion bodies (IBs) as the cells overexpress ferritin in an attempt to address iron accumulation while lacking the ability to clear ferritin and its aggregates. Overexpression and IB formation tax cells materially and energetically, i.e., their synthesis and disposal systems, and may hinder cellular transport and other spatially dependent functions. ICI causes cellular damage to proteins and lipids through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation because of high levels of brain oxygen, reductants and metabolism, taxing cellular repair. Iron can cause protein aggregation both indirectly by ROS-induced protein modification and destabilization, and directly as with mutant ferritin through C-terminal bridging. Iron release and ferritin degradation are also linked to cellular misfunction through ferritinophagy, which can release sufficient iron to initiate the unique programmed cell death process ferroptosis causing ROS formation and lipid peroxidation. But IB buildup suggests suppressed ferritinophagy, with elevated iron from four-fold pore leakage together with ROS damage and stress leading to a long-term ferroptotic-like state in HF. Several of these processes have parallels in cell line and mouse models. This review addresses the roles of ferritin structure and function within the above-mentioned framework, as they relate to HF and associated disorders characterized by abnormal iron accumulation, protein aggregation, oxidative damage, and the resulting contributions to cumulative cellular stress and death.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": []}, "31920187": {"ArticleTitle": "Advancement of Technology for Drug Discovery and Development - Part I.", "AbstractText": "", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Anesthesia", "Biological Products", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Drug Development", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Neoplasms"]}, "31918850": {"ArticleTitle": "Neuroendocrine Disturbances in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Scoping Review.", "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative diseases cause progressive irreversible neuronal loss that has broad downstream effects.

The aim of this paper is to conduct a meta-analysis of the available data on the total costs of treatment and care for elderly AD patients with respect to the stage of the disease determined by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The Web of Science and PubMed databases were used for a systematic search. Two independent reviewers screened the identified records and selected relevant articles published in the period from 2007 to 2017. A meta-analysis of costs is performed in three categories related to the stages of Alzheimer's disease (mild, moderate, and severe). The resulting estimation of total costs per patient per year determined by the meta-analysis is 20,461$ total costs. The total costs in relation to the stage of the disease according to the MMSE scale are 14,675 $ for the mild stage, 19,975 $ for the moderate stage, and 29,708 $ for the severe stage.

SVD is a major cause of stroke and dementia; features of SVD include white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin, lacunes of presumed vascular origin, microbleeds, and perivascular spaces. Cognitive impairment and dementia have traditionally been stratified into subtypes of varying origin, e.g., vascular dementia versus dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer's disease; AD). Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow in the brain, often as a result of SVD, and AD is thought to have its genesis in the accumulation of tau and amyloid-beta leading to brain atrophy. But after early seminal studies in the 1990s found neurovascular disease features in around 30% of AD patients, it is becoming recognised that so-called \"mixed pathologies\" (of vascular and neurodegenerative origin) exist in many more patients diagnosed with stroke, only one type of dementia, or cognitive impairment. On the back of these discoveries, attempts have recently been made to quantify the full extent of degenerative and vascular disease in the brain in vivo on MRI. The hope being that these \"global\" methods may one day lead to better diagnoses of disease and provide more sensitive measurements to detect treatment effects in clinical trials. Indeed, the \"Total MRI burden of cerebral small vessel disease\", the \"Brain Health Index\" (BHI), and \"MRI measure of degenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer disease\" have all been shown to have stronger associations with clinical and cognitive phenotypes than individual brain MRI features. This chapter will review individual structural brain MRI features commonly seen in SVD, stroke, and dementia. The relationship between these features and differing clinical and cognitive phenotypes will be discussed along with developments in their measurement and quantification.

Despite widespread medial and lateral prefrontal atrophy, the capacity to generate richly detailed and spatially coherent scenes in bvFTD was found to rely predominantly upon the integrity of right medial temporal structures, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Scene construction impairments in AD, by contrast, hinged upon the integrity of posterior parietal brain regions.

Here, we aimed to describe the functional and structural brain characteristics of older individuals, particularly focusing on those with stable working memory (WM) performance, as measured with a verbal N-back task across a 2-year follow-up interval. Forty-seven subjects were categorized as stables or decliners based on their WM change. Stables were further subdivided into high performers (SHP) and low performers (SLP), based on their baseline scores. At both time points, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired, including task-based functional MRI (fMRI) and structural T1-MRI.

Further, at follow-up, decliners exhibited more activity than SHP but in left temporo-parietal cortex and posterior cingulate (i.e., non-task-related areas).

Cannabis plant has many species, but there are three main species including Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis. Over 70 compounds isolated from cannabis species are called cannabinoids (CBN). Cannabinoids produce over 100 naturally occurring chemicals. The most abundant chemicals are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD). THC is psychotropic chemical that makes people feel \"high\" while CBD is nonpsychotropic chemical. However, cannabinoid chemicals are not found only in the cannabis plant, they are also produced by the mammalian body, called endocannabinoids and in the laboratory, called synthesized cannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are endogenous lipid-based retrograde neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors, and cannabinoid receptor proteins that are expressed throughout the mammalian central nervous system including brain and peripheral nervous system. There are at least two types of endocannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) which are G-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are particularly abundant in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, hypothalamus and cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. They are present in inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons and excitatory glutamatergic neurons. CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system, hematopoietic cells and glia cells. CB2 is mainly expressed in the periphery under normal healthy condition, but in conditions of disease or injury, this upregulation occurs within the brain, and CB2 is therefore expressed in the brain in unhealthy states. Cannabis and cannabinoid are studied in different medical conditions. The therapeutic potentials of both cannabis and cannabinoid are related to the effects of THC, CBD and other cannabinoid compounds. However, the \"high\" effect of THC in cannabis and cannabinoid may limit the clinical use, particularly, the study on the therapeutic potential of THC alone is more limited. This review emphasizes the therapeutic potential of CBD and CBD with THC. CBD has shown to have benefit in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, psychosis, neuropathic pain, cancer pain, HIV, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury and epilepsy.

Genetic variants in presenilin (PSEN) 1 and 2 genes lead to autosomal dominant early-onset AD (ADAD); patients with PSEN gene variants also report seizures. Pharmacological control of seizures in AD may be disease-modifying. Preclinical efficacy of FDA-approved antiseizure drugs (ASDs) is well defined in young adult rodents; however, the efficacy of ASDs in aged rodents with chronic seizures is less clear. The mechanism by which ADAD genes lead to AD remains unclear, and even less studied is the pathogenesis of epilepsy in AD. PSEN variants generally all result in a biochemical loss of function (De Strooper, 2007). We herein determined whether well-established models of acute and chronic seizure could be used to explore the relationship between AD genes and seizures through investigating whether loss of normal PSEN2 function age-dependently influenced susceptibility to seizures and/or corneal kindling acquisition. PSEN2 knockout (KO) and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were screened from 2- to 10-months-old to establish age-dependent focal seizure threshold. Additionally, PSEN2 KO and WT mice aged 2- and 8-months-old underwent corneal kindling such that mice were aged 3- and 9-months old at the beginning of ASD efficacy testing. We then defined the dose-dependent efficacy of mechanistically distinct ASDs on kindled seizures of young versus aged mice to better understand the applicability of corneal kindling to real-world use for geriatric patients. PSEN2 KO mice demonstrated early-life reductions in seizure threshold. However, kindling acquisition was delayed in 2-month-old PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. Young male WT mice took 24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 (S.E.M.) stimulations to achieve kindling criterion, whereas age-matched PSEN2 KO male mice took 41.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 stimulations (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The rate of kindling acquisition of 8-month-old mice was no longer different from WT. This study demonstrates that loss of normal PSEN2 function is associated with age-dependent changes in the in vivo susceptibility to acute seizures and kindling. Loss of normal PSEN2 function may be an underexplored molecular contributor to seizures.

The results found that all these factors could be attributed to mercury. The hallmark changes in AD include plaques, beta amyloid protein, neurofibrillary tangles, phosphorylated tau protein, and memory loss-all changes that can be caused by mercury. Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine are inhibited in patients with Alzheimer's disease, with the same inhibition occurring in mercury toxicity. Enzyme dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease include BACE 1, gamma secretase, cyclooxygenase-2, cytochrome-c-oxidase, protein kinases, monoamine oxidase, nitric oxide synthetase, acetyl choline transferase, and caspases, all which can be explained by mercury toxicity. Immune and inflammatory responses seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease also occur when cells are exposed to mercury, including complement activation, cytokine expression, production of glial fibrillary acid protein antibodies and interleukin-1, transforming growth factor, beta 2 microglobulins, and phosphodiesterase 4 stimulation.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25\u00a0AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively.

We found that administration of a GP extract caused a significantly reduction in the AD-associated phenotypes of the iNs, including decreased levels of extracellular A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as well as reduced Tau protein phosphorylation at positions Ser214 and Ser396. Additionally, the effect of GP was more prominent in AD-iNs compared to non-diseased controls. These findings provide valuable information that suggests moving extracts of GP toward drug development, either for treating AD or as a health supplement to prevent AD.

The following steps were different: water was injected through an injection port to expand the capsule, then the water sac was confirmed to be close to the gastric wall under endoscope, and, finally, the incision was sutured and covered. RESULTS Patient ages ranged from 42 to 93 years (60.8\u00b19.2 years, 91 males and 82 females).

Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, information fusion strategies with multi-modal neuroimaging data, such as voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI (VBM-MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown their effectiveness for AD diagnosis. However, most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multi-modal data, but do not make full use of structure information across the different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal neuroimaging feature selection method with consistent metric constraint (MFCC) for AD analysis. First, the similarity is calculated for each modality (i.e. VBM-MRI or FDG-PET) individually by random forest strategy, which can extract pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities. Then the group sparsity regularization term and the sample similarity constraint regularization term are used to constrain the objective function to conduct feature selection from multiple modalities. Finally, the multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different models for final classification. The experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) show that the proposed method has better classification performance than the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods. Specifically, we achieved higher accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for AD versus normal controls (NC), MCI versus NC, and MCI converters (MCI-C) versus MCI non-converters (MCI-NC) on ADNI datasets.

In Case 2, a 70-year-old man with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and hypertension presented with acute loss of consciousness and left hemiparesis, without evidence of hypoglycemia or a hypertensive crisis. In both cases, ASL-MRI perfusion images showed focal cerebral hyperperfusion in the posterior cingulate and parietal associative cortex, which involved neurodegenerative areas associated with epilepsy in early Alzheimer's disease. In both cases, the patients developed generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizures that lasted for 5 minutes or more, which indicated the emergence of status epilepticus that developed from the initial presentation of NCSE. In both cases, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings confirmed that the seizures were controlled by intravenous administration of antiepileptic drugs.

To address this public health problem, the research community has developed computational approaches to sift through various aspects of clinical data and uncover their insights, among which one of the most challenging problem is to determine the biological mechanisms that cause AD to develop. To study this problem, in this paper we present a novel Joint Multi-Modal Longitudinal Regression and Classification method and show how it can be used to identify the cognitive status of the participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and the underlying biological mechanisms. By intelligently combining clinical data of various modalities (i.e., genetic information and brain scans) using a variety of regularizations that can identify AD-relevant biomarkers, we perform the regression and classification tasks simultaneously. Because the proposed objective is a non-smooth optimization problem that is difficult to solve in general, we derive an efficient iterative algorithm and rigorously prove its convergence. To validate our new method in predicting the cognitive scores of patients and their clinical diagnosis, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the ADNI cohort. Our promising results demonstrate the benefits and flexibility of the proposed method.

Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends.

Notably, learning intrinsic structures from multiple heterogeneous features is significant but challenging in multi-view disease understanding. Different from existing methods that separately deal with each single view, this paper proposes a discriminative Margin-Sensitive Autoencoder (MSAE) framework for automated Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and accurate protein fold recognition. Generally, our MSAE aims to collaboratively explore the complementary properties of multi-view bioimage features in a semantic-sensitive encoder-decoder paradigm, where the discriminative semantic space is explicitly constructed in a margin-scalable regression model. Specifically, we develop a semantic-sensitive autoencoder, where an encoder projects multi-view visual features into the common semantic-aware latent space, and a decoder is exerted as an additional constraint to reconstruct the respective visual features. In particular, the importance of different views is adaptively weighted by self-adjusting learning scheme, such that their underlying correlations and complementary characteristics across multiple views are simultaneously preserved into the latent common representations. Moreover, a flexible semantic space is formulated by a margin-scalable support vector machine to improve the discriminability of the learning model. Importantly, correntropy induced metric is exploited as a robust regularization measurement to better control outliers for effective classification. A half-quadratic minimization and alternating learning strategy are devised to optimize the resulting framework such that each subproblem exists a closed-form solution in each iterative minimization phase. Extensive experimental results performed on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets show that our MSAE can achieve superior performances for both binary and multi-class classification in AD diagnosis, and evaluations on protein folds demonstrate that our method can achieve very encouraging performance on protein structure recognition, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Databases, Factual", "Discrimination Learning", "Humans", "Neuroimaging", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Support Vector Machine"]}, "31837501": {"ArticleTitle": "Design, synthesis and evaluation of diosgenin carbamate derivatives as multitarget anti-Alzheimer's disease agents.", "AbstractText": "In order to produce an effective and multi-targeted clinical drug that could prevent progressive neurodegeneration, a series of diosgenin carbamate derivatives were designed, synthesized and tested for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-A\u03b2 activities.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Here, we examined the effect of butein on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells grown with conditioned medium from BV2 microglia cells that had been activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a neuroinflammation model. We found butein pretreatment significantly increased SH-SY5Y cell viability in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting the apoptosis normally induced by microglia-conditioned medium. SH-SY5Y cells treated with microglia-conditioned medium showed upregulated ERK signaling pathway-related mRNA expression and protein phosphorylation, which was dose-dependently reversed by butein.

Fortunately, cells have evolved several antioxidant defense mechanisms (as metabolites, vitamins, and enzymes) to neutralize or mitigate the harmful effect of reactive species and/or their byproducts. Any perturbation in the balance in the level of antioxidants and the reactive species results in a physiological condition called \"oxidative stress.\" A catalase is one of the crucial antioxidant enzymes that mitigates oxidative stress to a considerable extent by destroying cellular hydrogen peroxide to produce water and oxygen. Deficiency or malfunction of catalase is postulated to be related to the pathogenesis of many age-associated degenerative diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, vitiligo, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, cancer, and schizophrenia. Therefore, efforts are being undertaken in many laboratories to explore its use as a potential drug for the treatment of such diseases. This paper describes the direct and indirect involvement of deficiency and/or modification of catalase in the pathogenesis of some important diseases such as diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vitiligo, and acatalasemia.

PARP-1 enzymatic activity has been shown to be necessary for the expression of several genes required for memory formation and consolidation. Previously, we showed that nucleolar PARP-1 is significantly decreased in hippocampal pyramidal cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We proposed that the displacement of PARP-1 from the nucleolus results in downregulation of new rRNA expression and ribosome biogenesis, leading to cognitive impairment. To further investigate the relationship between nucleolar PARP-1 and memory impairment, we examined PARP-1 expression in the hippocampi of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to control and AD cases. We used immunohistochemical techniques to examine the nucleolar distribution of PARP-1 in the Cornu Ammonis (CA region) of the hippocampus. PARP-1 positive cells were then scored for the presence or absence of PARP-1 in the nucleolus. We found a significant decrease of PARP-1 staining in the nucleolar compartment of hippocampal pyramidal cells in MCI compared with Control and AD. When the four CA (CA1-4) regions were considered separately, only the CA1 region showed significant differences in nucleolar PARP-1 with Control > AD > MCI cases. Categorization of nucleolar PARP-1 into \"distinct\" and \"diffuse\" groups suggest that most of the changes occur within the distinct group. In addition, measurements of the nucleolar diameter of nucleolar PARP-1 positive cells in CA2 and CA4 showed Control > MCI. Thus, MCI cases had a lower percentage of PARP-1 nucleolar positive cells in CA1 and smaller nucleolar diameters in CA2 and CA4, compared to Control.

Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time.

In this article I describe a hypothesis on the entire pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, based on the most wellknown pathological elements in AD, filling the gaps with hypothetical mechanisms. This proposed mechanism of derailed repair starts with an insufficiently increased level of injury signalling in the axon by ApoE, DLK, APP, BACE-1, A\u03b2 and iPLA2\u03b2, followed by an excessive repair response induced by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, release of mitochondrial CoA and activation of palmitoylation and massive endocytosis. Excessive compounds, associated with injury signalling and repair, start to accumulate, adding to axonal injury. This increased activation of the repair mechanism causes exhaustion of the repair response by lack of mitochondrial CoA.

Statistically TWAS is a (two-sample) 2-stage least squares (2SLS) method in the framework of instrumental variables analysis for causal inference: in Stage 1 it uses the reference eQTL data to impute a genes expression for the main GWAS data, then in Stage 2 it tests for association between the imputed gene expression and the GWAS trait; if an association is detected in Stage 2, a (putatively) causal relationship between the gene and the GWAS trait is claimed. If a nonlinear model or a generalized linear model (GLM) is fitted in Stage 2 (e.g., for a binary GWAS trait), it is known that using only imputed gene expression, as in standard TWAS, in general does not lead to a consistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) estimate for the causal effect; accordingly, a variation of 2SLS, called two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI), has been proposed to yield better estimates (e.g., being consistent under suitable conditions). Our main goal is to investigate whether it is necessary or even better to apply 2SRI, instead of the standard 2SLS.

In other words, in many cases we can access to plenty of information on ligands that bind to specific protein, but less or almost no information showing that compounds don't bind to proteins of interest. In this paper, we suggested an approach to comprehensively explore candidates for ligands specifically targeting toward proteins without using information on the true negative interaction. The approach consists of 4 steps: 1) constructing a model that distinguishes ligands for the target proteins of interest from those targeting proteins that cause off-target effects, by using graph convolution neural network (GCNN); 2) extracting feature vectors after convolution/pooling processes and mapping their principal components in two dimensions; 3) specifying regions with higher density for two ligand groups through kernel density estimation; and 4) investigating the distribution of compounds for exploration on the density map using the same classifier and decomposer.

The bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), has been extensively studied in cardiovascular diseases and digestive diseases. However, the role of FXR in AD is not yet understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of FXR function in AD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Lentivirus infection, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and western blotting were used to detect the gain or loss of FXR in cell apoptosis induced by A\u00df. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the molecular partners involved in A\u00df-induced apoptosis. RESULTS We found that the mRNA and protein expression of FXR was enhanced in Ab-triggered neuronal apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and in mouse hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of FXR aggravated A\u00df-triggered neuronal apoptosis in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and this effect was further increased by treatment with the FXR agonist 6ECDCA. Molecular mechanism analysis by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting revealed that FXR interacted with the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), leading to decreased CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels. Low expression of FXR mostly reversed the A\u00df-triggered neuronal apoptosis effect and prevented the reduction in CREB and BDNF.

Recent studies have indicated that the prion protein (PrP) is one of the cell-surface receptors, so-called a bad receptor, of A\u03b2 oligomers that mediates downstream cellular toxicity. A rational classification of A\u03b2 oligomers on the basis of conformation indicates that there are two distinct types of oligomers, namely, prefibrillar and fibrillar oligomers that are positive to A11 and OC conformation-dependent antibodies, respectively. The mechanism of heterotypic assembly of conformationally distinct oligomers and PrP is poorly understood. In this work, using an array of biophysical and biochemical tools, we dissect the molecular mechanism of the interaction of A11- and OC-positive A\u03b242 oligomers with human PrP. Using site-specific binding titrations, we show that the recruitment of A\u03b2 oligomers primarily occurs via the electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of PrP and A\u03b2 oligomers. Our results demonstrate that OC-positive fibrillar oligomers possessing in-register parallel \u03b2-sheet packing displayed \u223c30 times stronger binding with PrP compared to A11-positive oligomers. We also show that these OC-positive oligomers exacerbate their toxic effects on mammalian cells upon binding to PrP. On the contrary, the addition of PrP does not alter the toxicity exhibited by A11-positive oligomers.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a key axonal transport cargo since disruption to APP transport promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Moreover, altered APP processing itself disrupts axonal transport. The mechanisms that regulate axonal transport of APP are therefore directly relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. APP is transported anterogradely through axons on kinesin-1 motors and one route for this transport involves calsyntenin-1, a type-1 membrane spanning protein that acts as a direct ligand for kinesin-1 light chains (KLCs). Thus, loss of calsyntenin-1 disrupts APP axonal transport and promotes amyloidogenic processing of APP. Phosphorylation of KLC1 on serine-460 has been shown to reduce anterograde axonal transport of calsyntenin-1 by inhibiting the KLC1-calsyntenin-1 interaction. Here we demonstrate that in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex, KLC1 levels are reduced and the relative levels of KLC1 serine-460 phosphorylation are increased; these changes occur relatively early in the disease process. We also show that a KLC1 serine-460 phosphomimetic mutant inhibits axonal transport of APP in both mammalian neurons in culture and in Drosophila neurons in vivo.

Despite prolonged and expensive efforts employed by the scientific community over the last few decades, no effective treatments are still available for patients, and the development of disease-modifying drugs is now a really urgent need. The recent failure of clinical trials based on the immunotherapeutic approach against amyloid-\u03b2(A\u03b2) protein questioned the validity of the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" as the molecular machinery causing the disease. Indeed, most attempts to design effective treatments for AD have been based until now on molecular targets suggested to be implicated in AD pathogenesis by the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, mounting evidence from scientific literature supports the view of AD as a multifactorial disease that results from the concomitant action of multiple molecular players. This view, together with the lack of success of the disease-modifying single-target approaches, strongly suggests that AD drug design needs to be shifted towards multi-targeted compounds or drug combinations acting synergistically on the main core features of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of drug candidates targeting multiple factors involved in AD would greatly improve drug development.

Necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis characterized by the assembly of the necrosome complex composed of phosphorylated proteins, i.e. receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 and 3 (pRIPK1 and pRIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), has recently been shown to be involved in AD. However, it is not yet clear whether necrosome assembly takes place in brain regions showing AD-related neuronal loss and whether it is associated with AD-related neuropathological changes. Here, we analyzed brains of AD, pathologically defined preclinical AD (p-preAD) and non-AD control cases to determine the neuropathological characteristics and distribution pattern of the necrosome components. We demonstrated that all three activated necrosome components can be detected in GVD lesions (GVDn+, i.e. GVD with activated necrosome) in neurons, that they colocalize with classical GVD markers, such as pTDP-43 and CK1\u03b4, and similarly to these markers detect GVD lesions. GVDn\u2009+\u2009neurons inversely correlated with neuronal density in the early affected CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the late affected frontal cortex layer III. Additionally, AD-related GVD lesions were associated with AD-defining parameters, showing the strongest correlation and partial colocalization with NFT pathology. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of the necrosome in GVD plays a role in AD, possibly by representing an AD-specific form of necroptosis-related neuron death.

SCRN1 accumulation was also examined in two cases with both Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD)-Tau and AD-related neuropathology, cases of Down Syndrome (DS) with AD (n\u2009=\u20095), one case of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - Dutch type (HCHWA-D) and other non-AD tauopathies including: primary age-related tauopathy (PART, [n\u2009=\u20095]), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD, [n\u2009=\u20095]), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP, [n\u2009=\u20095]) and Pick's disease (PiD, [n\u2009=\u20094]). Immunohistochemistry showed that SCRN1 was a neuronal protein that abundantly accumulated in NFTs and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites throughout the progression of AD. Quantification of SCRN1 immunohistochemistry confirmed that SCRN1 preferentially accumulated in NFTs in comparison to surrounding non-tangle containing neurons at both early and late stages of AD. Similar results were observed in DS with AD and PART. However, SCRN1 did not co-localize with phosphorylated tau inclusions in CBD, PSP or PiD. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that SCRN1 interacted with phosphorylated tau in human AD brain tissue. Together, these results suggest that SCRN1 is uniquely associated with tau pathology in AD, DS and PART. As such, SCRN1 has potential as a novel therapeutic target and could serve as a useful biomarker to distinguish AD from other tauopathies.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Binding", "Tauopathies", "tau Proteins"]}, "31795610": {"ArticleTitle": "Neuregulin-1 Protects Neuronal Cells Against Damage due to CoCl2-Induced Hypoxia by Suppressing Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 and P53 in SH-SY5Y Cells.", "AbstractText": "Hypoxia-mediated neurotoxicity contributes to various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease.

To this end, we used synaptosomes as a model system to study the functionality of the synaptic regions in mouse brains.

More importantly, after the contextual fear conditioning, de novo synthesis of some individual proteins was significantly enhanced in the synaptosomes of control animals, but the TgCRND8 mice failed to display such synaptic modulation by training.

However, the origin of EEG spikes in transgenic AD model mice has remained elusive, which makes it difficult to relate electrophysiology with underlying pathology at the cellular and molecular level.

Cortical spikes associated with muscle twitches, cortico-hippocampal spikes, and spindle and fast-spindle associated spikes were present equally often in both APP/PS1 and wild-type mice, whereas pure cortical spikes were slightly more common in APP/PS1 mice.

It has been suggested that this interaction is strongly related to vascular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), i.e., cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), perivascular space, and the glymphatic system, the latter proposedly responsible for the drainage of solutes from the brain parenchyma, may represent key pathophysiological pathways linking stroke, A\u03b2 deposition, and dementia.In this review, we propose a hypothetic connection between CAA, stroke, perivascular space integrity, and dementia. Based on relevant pre-clinical research and a few clinical case reports, we speculate that impaired perivascular space integrity, inflammation, hypoxia, and BBB breakdown after stroke can lead to accelerated deposition of A\u03b2 within brain parenchyma and cerebral vessel walls or exacerbation of CAA. The deposition of A\u03b2 in the parenchyma would then be the initiating event leading to synaptic dysfunction, inducing cognitive decline and dementia.

The risk factors for AD include genetic mutations, lifestyle and environmental pollution. Particularly, lead (Pb) has attracted attention due to its ability to target multiple pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Although the epidemiological data are limiting, animal and in vitro studies show growing evidence of causal effects of Pb exposure on AD-linked features including A\u03b2 aggregation and tau phosphorylation. Interestingly, many Pb effects occur selectively following early-life exposure to the metal, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by changes in DNA methylation and microRNA expression patterns inflicted by early-life Pb exposure. Pb pollution in Mexico represents a significant problem because past and current mining activities, historical use of Pb as fuel additive and culturally rooted use of Pb in glazed ceramics, contribute to high levels of Pb pollution in Mexico. In this review we will discuss potential risks of AD development in Mexican populations chronically exposed to Pb in their childhood.", "Query": ["ALZHEIMERS"], "MeshHeading": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Child", "Child Development", "DNA", "DNA Methylation", "Environmental Exposure", "Environmental Pollutants", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Humans", "Lead", "Mexico", "Risk Factors", "tau Proteins"]}, "31773124": {"ArticleTitle": "Eupulcherol A, a triterpenoid with a new carbon skeleton from Euphorbia pulcherrima, and its anti-Alzheimer's disease bioactivity.", "AbstractText": "Eupulcherol A (1), a novel triterpenoid with an unprecedented carbon skeleton, was isolated from Euphorbia pulcherrima.

Since Alzheimer's disease cannot be cured yet, considerable efforts are being made to at least delay this cognitive decline among elderly in order to maintain and prolong the quality of their life. This can also be achieved by non-pharmacological approaches such as performing physical activities, cognitive training, or adhering to a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). One of the components of MedDiet - extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) - has considerable health benefits. The purpose of this review is to examine the effect of EVOO intake on the delay of cognitive decline among the elderly. The methodology is based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in three acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the regular intake of EVOO is associated with enhanced cognitive functions, which means that this oil may have a neuroprotective effect and could positively prevent the development of dementia, especially Alzheimer's dementia. It is believed that secoiridoid oleuropein is responsible for this effectiveness.

Four days after the lesion, anti-A\u03b2 labeling decreased and only remained in patches unlabeled by methoxy-X04 near microglia.

We conducted genome-wide association studies of Horvath-EAA and Hannum-EAA in 13,493 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, to elucidate genetic determinants of differential epigenetic ageing. We identified ten independent SNPs associated with Horvath-EAA, five of which are novel. We also report 21 Horvath-EAA-associated genes including several involved in metabolism (NHLRC, TPMT) and immune system pathways (TRIM59, EDARADD). GWAS of Hannum-EAA identified one associated variant (rs1005277), and implicated 12 genes including several involved in innate immune system pathways (UBE2D3, MANBA, TRIM46), with metabolic functions (UBE2D3, MANBA), or linked to lifespan regulation (CISD2). Both measures had nominal inverse genetic correlations with father's age at death, a rough proxy for lifespan.

Therefore, detection of the presence of A\u03b2 in AD brain tissue is a valuable tool for developing new treatments to prevent the progression of AD. Several classical amyloid binding dyes, fluorochrome, imaging probes, and A\u03b2-specific antibodies have been used to detect A\u03b2 histochemically in AD brain tissue. Use of these compounds for A\u03b2 detection is costly and time consuming. However, because of its intense fluorescent activity, high-affinity, and specificity for A\u03b2, as well as structural similarities with traditional amyloid binding dyes, curcumin (Cur) is a promising candidate for labeling and imaging of A\u03b2 plaques in postmortem brain tissue. It is a natural polyphenol from the herb Curcuma longa. In the present study, Cur was used to histochemically label A\u03b2 plaques from both a genetic mouse model of 5x familial Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD) and from human AD tissue within a minute. The labeling capability of Cur was compared to conventional amyloid binding dyes, such as thioflavin-S (Thio-S), Congo red (CR), and Fluoro-jade C (FJC), as well as A\u03b2-specific antibodies (6E10 and A11). We observed that Cur is the most inexpensive and quickest way to label and image A\u03b2 plaques when compared to these conventional dyes and is comparable to A\u03b2-specific antibodies.

An alternative and complementary treatment used for AD is Manual Acupuncture (MA). To assess the learning and memory ability of AD model mice, the MWM test was conducted. The visible platform trial, hidden platform trial, probe trial, and reversal trial of MWM were used to evaluate spatial learning and memory ability. In the visible platform trial, the swimming speed and escape latency of mice in different groups was not significantly different. In the hidden platform and reversal trials, the AD group showed a long escape latency. The escape latency decreased significantly after the MA treatment. Low platform crossover number and the proportion of time in the SW quadrant in the probe trial increased after the MA treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01).

In this review, we describe and discuss recent evidence from human postmortem and clinical biomarker studies addressing the differential vulnerability of brain areas to tau pathology, its cell-to-cell transmission, and characteristics of the different strains that tau aggregates can adopt. Cellular biosensor assays are increasingly used in human tissue to detect the earliest forms of tau pathology, before overt histopathological lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles) are apparent. Animal models with localized tau expression are used to uncover the mechanisms that influence spreading of tau aggregates. Further, studies of human postmortem-derived tau filaments from different tauopathies injected in rodents have led to striking findings that recapitulate neuropathology-based staging of tau. Furthermore, the recent advent of tau positron emission tomography and novel fluid-based biomarkers render it possible to study the temporal progression of tau pathology in\u00a0vivo.
